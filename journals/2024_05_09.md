	- Buttons are crucial UI elements designed for users to take action. Here are the key best practices for effective button design:
	- ### Appearance
	- Make buttons look like buttons and visually differentiate primary and secondary actions.[1]
	- Buttons are distinct from links - buttons invite action, links navigate.[1]
	- Avoid more than one primary action button per screen.[1]
	- ### Placement
	- In small windows, place primary button bottom right.[1]
	- For full pages, place primary button below last content on left.[1]
	- ### Wording
	- Use simple, concise, task-specific words clearly explaining the action.[1]
	- Avoid generic commands like "OK" - repeat the verb instead.[1]
	- Be clear about what will happen next after clicking.[1]
	- ### Destructive Actions
	- For critical operations, use small dialog boxes and clear wording to focus attention.[1]
	- Allow undoing accidental destructive actions.[1]
	  
	  Following established UI patterns and user expectations is key for intuitive, user-centered button design.[1]

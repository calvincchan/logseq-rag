  - Axiom is a browser extension that enables no-code automation of website actions and repetitive tasks. Its key features include visual web scraping, data entry, spreadsheet automation, and the ability to automate any website without coding. Users can build custom bots or use pre-built templates, and automate actions like clicking and typing on websites. Bots can be run manually, scheduled, or triggered from Zapier or other integrations like ChatGPT. Axiom is praised for its powerful features, ease of setup, and excellent support.
- **21:22** Docker force IP:

  - To prevent Docker Compose from allocating IP addresses in the `192.168.0.0/16` range, you can specify a custom default address pool for the Docker daemon. This can be done by editing the Docker daemon configuration file.

    Here are the steps:

  - Open the Docker daemon configuration file. This file is usually located at `/etc/docker/daemon.json`. If the file doesn't exist, you can create it.
  - Add or modify the `default-address-pools` setting to specify a different IP range. For example:

    ```
    {
    "default-address-pools": [
      {
        "base": "172.20.0.0/16",
        "size": 24
      }
    ]
    }
    ```

  - In this example, Docker will allocate networks in the `172.20.0.0/16` range.
  - Save the file and restart the Docker daemon. The command to restart the Docker daemon depends on your system. On a system that uses `systemd`, you can use `sudo systemctl restart docker`.

    Please note that this will affect all Docker networks, not just the ones created by Docker Compose. If you have other applications that rely on Docker networks in the `192.168.0.0/16` range, they may be affected by this change.
